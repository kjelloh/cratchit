  BUG:  SIE <-> Ta Synchronization old and new still shaky
        The 'new' synchronization does not seem to import new SIE aggretae members into tagged amounts?
        I changed to 'old' brute force reading of SIE environment -> tagged amounts.
        At first this did also not seem to import new SIE aggregate members to tagged amounts?
        Then, while debugging and adding trace logging - it did ?!
        TODO: Track down this bug! We need SIE -> Tagged amounts synchronization to be water tight!

2024-07-13

          ? Consider a mechanism to create the yearly "write off" transaction "1229	Ackumulerade avskrivningar på inventarier och verktyg" <--> "7830	Avskrivningar på maskiner och inventarier"?
            The Swedish rules stipulates that the company must keep the saldo on the inventory accounts unchanged but book Depreciation on 1229 <-> 7830 (reduced value as cost)
            For my company I have accounts 1226 and 1227 as inventory accounts + a Numbers document to calculate the yearly Depreciation.
            Then at the end of the year I must book all these depreciations on 1229 (reduced value) and 7830 (cost)

          BUG: The command "-omslutning ..." logs the processing printing BAS account numbers in hex-format.
          FIXED (all std::hex output directives are now reset with a matching std::dec to use as default)

          DESIGN_INSUFFICIENCY: Cratchit does not include BAS accounts that has no activity in command '-omslutning...'

          BUG: The '-omslutning' and '-huvudbok' seems to exclude transactions on the end date of the period?
               No, the BUG is that newly imported I-aggregates refers to members that are not in tagged amounts.
               See BUG: SIE <-> Ta Synchronization old and new still shaky

            ? Consider to implement a BAS / SIE mechanism to always balance VAT accounts 1650 (debit) and 2650 (credit)
              to use only one?
              If the total VAT balance is negative I owe SKV and cratchit should use a credit amount on 2650? 
              If the total VAT balance is positive SKV owe me and cratchit should use a debit amount on 1650?

            DESIGN_INSUFFICIENCY: For '-huvudbok <year_id>' accounts with no transactions but non-zero balance are NOT listed
                    (Consider to make the mechanism list all non-zero-saldo-accounts?)

            DESIGN_INSUFFICIENCY: Cratchit can't export unposted (changes) för 'previous year' (cratchit.se is for current year only)
                (Consider to have cratchit_0.se and cratchit_1.se for current and previous year 'unposted'?)
                (In this way we can exchange data with external application when we close previous fiscal year?)

            BUG: Cratchit does not apply changes to tagged amounts when importing changed SIE entries (external app changes).
            FIXED: Activated synchronize_tagged_amounts_with_sie and now external SIE changes ends up as tagged amount ok.

            DESIGN_INSUFFIENCY: The synchronize_tagged_amounts_with_sie does NOT remove orphan BAS transactions 
              (those left over from older SIE members when SIE aggregate with changed members are imported)

            ? Consider a mechanism where cratchit can compare bank and skv statements for a whole fiscal year with current book entries?
              (Could be used when closing the books to verify that all is booked ok?)

            DESIGN_INSUFFICIENCY: Can't register entries on previous year to close the books.
              (Consider to enable cratchit to operate on the previous year + correctly handle the cratchit_1.se addition to export -1 year changes)
2024-07-06

            BUG: The generated sie-file cratchit.se now have error in its encoding again!
                 The file ends up with 'EF BF BD' which is UTF-8 for '?'.

            BUG: Cratchit craches for processing had for VAT returns (stack overflow)
                 #0 0x103959c4b in WrappedDoubleAmount::trunc(WrappedDoubleAmount::Amount const&) main.cpp:1105
            FIXED: The code called itself instead of std::trunc.

            BUG: We do not get unposted from cratchit.se into app on startup.
            FIXED: Now correctly consumes empty lines in sie-file + don't create sie-file 
                   cratchit.se with an initial empty line.

            ? Consider to add command '-sie -update' to update the sie year index to coincide with current date?
            ? Consider to make the environment file a rolling history of changed files?
              (This would enable a backup to go back to if/when entries are wrong or application malfunctions)
            ? Consider to 'import' sie-files in 'from_sie' by renaming the used on to its 'year id' e.g., theitfied_1.se for the -1 year id?
              Also consider to put a plain copy of the imported sie-file in to sub-folder 'consumed'?
            BUG: When importing a changed sie-file (in test an M1 verification was changed to an A1 one),
                 then the no longer existing aggregate is no longer present as tagged amount in the environment file.
                 But, the members still remains as 'orphan' tagged amounts (tagged 'parent_SIE=M1' for nor non existent aggregate M1)
                 ==> Todo: Find a way to prune also aggregate members for aggregates that no longer exist in applied 'from sie' file.

                 ? Consider to prune amounts tagged to 'have' a member but where the member no longer exists?
            ? Consider to filter import from skv-file (and csv-file) with account statements to a specified period?
              (This would make it easier to adapt to the web-interface of SKV that is cumbersome to make export for a period).

            Observation: In state '-tas' (PromptState::TAIndex) current commands are
                          "-has_tag" to filter current selection on tagged amounts having specified tag.

            Test: To turn account statements into hads I could 
                  1) Use command '-tas 20240401 20240630' to get all tagged amounts for Q2
                  2) Use command '-has_tag Account' to filter out all account statements
                  3) Use command '-to_hads' to get a had from each currently selected account statement

            ? Consider to have Cratchit generate plain text files for the user to print?
              I imagine a command -print that writes the last prompt to a file 'to_print/<state>.txt' or simmilar?
              We can in this way be able to print all current hads in state '-hads' (PromptState::HADIndex)?

            ? Consider to confirm entry of a had (now it is silent)

            BUG: Cratchit can't handle had input "Faktura Webbsupport webbhotell 7/7 - 11/10 896,25 2024-05-29".
                 TODO: Find a new way to handle heading-amount-date so that it is sufficient if the 
                       two last tokens matched date then amount (and make any text before those be the hading)?

            ? Consider to enable removing the last had in current list (to trim down the list)
              Currently one can only remove a single had after a '-hads' command.

            ? Consider to add a command to show the mapping from sie year index to actual files?
              (I missed to move current to -1 when I manually updated to a new year and did not 'see' it)

            BUG: There is no lock from entering an SIE entry with a date belonging to previous fiscal year!

            ? Consider to show saldo on each BAS account after having added an SIE entry?
              (To be able to verify with any saldo shown on e.g., account statements from bank or SKV?)

            ? Consider to list templates for a selected had in date order and 'match'-order and restrict the list to fit on one screen?
              (For now, I can get hundreds of suggestions)
              E.g, consider to limit the number of 'account set' used in template aggregate (no need to repeat simmilar aggregates of BAS accounts and signs)

            ? Consider to implement a mechanism that can detect that a had from an account statement is 'the same' as one already booked?
              (this happens when the same account statement is imported from e.g., skv-file and bank csv-file for payment of VAT skv <-> bank)

            ? Consider to show the diff between debit and credit while editing an sie aggregate (journal entry)
              (This helps when entering "Öres- och kronutjämning":3740)

              Also consider to always show member entries in falling amount size?
              (In this way we can edit amounts top-down and potentially push any imbalance 'down the stack' until it ends up in "Öres- och kronutjämning":3740)

            ? Consider a way to undo application of a template?
              (Would be convenient if one happens to select the wrong template)

            ? Consider a mechanism so that the process account-statement -> had -> sie aggregate leaves all amounts immutable?
              (That is, account statement and had remains but had gets tagged to have used an account statement and an sie aggregate
               gets tagged to have come from a had)?
               In this way we can also have sie-aggregate use different account statements for 1920,1930 and 1630 (same event but different locations)

            ? Consider to have Cratchit save the environment continuously into an history of immutable files?
              (In this way we are more secure against crashes and may also be able to 'undo')

            ? Consider to implement a VAT return statement mechanism that only uses the defined period data?
              (Current implementation uses a rolling window of 6 months to be safe against erroneous difference between report to SKV and actual VAT to report)

            ? Consider to implement some mechanism so that cratchit can zero out multiple VAT accounts on VAT Returns generation?
              Also, make cratchit book the correct amount on "Öres- och kronutjämning":3740 required to zero out e.g., 2641 but have "Redovisningskonto för moms":2650
              be whole SEK.
              Also, make cratchit use 2650 for VAT to pay to SKV and 1650 for VAT to get from SKV?

            Observation:  Web based Fortnox app can not generate a VAT report entry that spans over the split of two fiscal years (e.g., Q2 [Apr..June]).
                          It seems we need to close of the April VAT period first so that the balances gets transferred to the new year.
                          Then we must close May and June on the new year and build it on top of the VAT balance from April.

            ? Consider to make Cratchit be able to generate two verifications when closing a VAT period (one for each side of a fiscal year boundary).

2024-06-30  ? Do we actually need to keep track of SIE concept 'year id'
              That is, keeping an index 0,-1,-2 that indicates how each financial year
              relates to current date?

            * SIEEnvironments is a map year_id -> SIEEnvironment
              E.g. "for (auto const& [year_id,sie_env] : sie_envs)..."

            * Environment 'SRU:s' are mapped to year_id as in 'SRU:S "1000=21300;4504=125000;year_id=0"'

            * to_fiscal_year_date_range(std::string const& year_id) is used to 'know'
              what '-huvudbok' and '-omslutning' to show

            * year_id is used for '-sru <year_id>' to list environment SRU values for a specific relative finacial year
              Also, 'for (auto const& [year_id,sru_env] : model->sru)'
              and,  'using SRUEnvironments = std::map<std::string,SRUEnvironment>;'

2024-06-30  ? Can we just enter a verification into the right SIE finacial year based on the verifiaction date?

              Idea: Protect an SIE year by detecting if an 2099 <-> 8999 transaction is booked (as this indicated booking the closed year result)
                    The user must delete the 2099 <-> 8999 entry to be able to enter new finacial year events?
                    Or, the user is allowed to add entries as long as the result in the 2099 <-> 8999 is not affected?

              Idea: Try to implement an 'automatic' adjustment of how financial years relates to current date?
                    That is, if the financial year at index 0 is no longer a date range that includes current year,
                    then shift the index down (--1) and adjust all mapping form year_id -> thing to remain correct
                    E.g., the 'sie_file' entry in the Environment needs to shift so that refered to SIE-files
                    now uses an index that corresponds to current IRL date.
